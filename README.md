# MME55
Geometries of the MME55 benchmark set [https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00558](https://doi.org/10.1021/acs.jctc.3c00558). This set contains metalloenzyme model reaction energies and barrier heights for 10 different enzymes, representing eight transition metals, both open and closed shell systems, and system sizes of up to 116 atoms.

Each structure is found in a seperate directory as xyz file format. Charges and unpaired electrons are indicated in .CHRG and .UHF files.
